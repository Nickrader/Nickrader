Hi, Iâ€™m @Nickrader, trying to git guud at programming.

I should've stayed in math/science in school, 
but, after two years,went into a business major 
instead :(

Many years later I decided to not only play video
games (RTS, TBS, FPS), but start learning about the 
electronics that run them.

I bought a [FDM printer kit](https://folgertech.com/products/folger-tech-reprap-2020-prusa-i3-full-aluminum-3d-printer-kit) and a Raspberry Pi and struggled
to get it working.  The benefit was I learned a lot just
to get my first print.

After some fun with hardware, I realized software was the next
logical step.  All the nuts, bolts and motors in the world would 
do me little good, if I was unable to craft instructions.  The 
same way a 3dprinter was of proportionally less value to me 
when I depended on others for [.stl files](https://www.thingiverse.com/) before learning some
basic [CAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/free-trial#) skills.

I speak, poorly, bits of French and German, but have always been interested in linguistics.  
In college my professor introduced me to the [IPA Handbook](https://www.internationalphoneticassociation.org/content/handbook-ipa), which I found fascinating, the 
description of human languages in a universal and systematic way.

I am a fan of the role that AI and Robotics can play in the realization 
of a [Post-scarcity economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy).

To scare myself at night, I ponder [The Great Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Filter).  

I love trees and mountains.
